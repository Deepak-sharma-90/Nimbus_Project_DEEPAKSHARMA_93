# 🔐 Cyber Security Password Strength Analyzer

*A C Language Project -- Password Security Evaluation using Strings,
Loops, Functions, Pointers & File Handling*

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a **Password Strength Analyzer** in C that
evaluates the strength of user-entered passwords based on multiple
security factors. It also provides **suggestions for improvement** if
the password is weak and logs the results in a file using **File I/O**.

## 🎯 Core Features

-   Evaluates password strength based on:
    -   Length
    -   Uppercase
    -   Lowercase
    -   Digits
    -   Special Characters
-   Provides improvement suggestions\
-   Uses modular functions\
-   Dynamic memory allocation with pointers\
-   Logs results into a file\
-   Single C file implementation

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes

-   Flowchart creation\
-   String and decision control usage\
-   Loop and function implementation\
-   Pointer-based input handling\
-   File handling

## 📚 Syllabus Concepts Used

-   Strings\
-   Loops\
-   Functions\
-   Pointers\
-   Decision Control\
-   File Handling

## ▶️ Compilation

    gcc password_analyzer.c -o analyzer
    ./analyzer

## ▶️ Output Example

    Password Strength Score: 3/5
    Password is WEAK.
